# Eye-Movement-Exercise
An exercise in creating animation and mouse tracker events. Initially when I did this I admittedly used the starter codes from our class, and I had a hard time making two eyeballs, so this was a good lesson in manipulating HTML to make everything align. I also added a pop of color, which was fun. I'm looking forward to eventually adding a little emoji looking character in this, or something else along those lines!
Make sure and open up the file folder, clone and fork the folder, open up your favorite editor and get coding!
